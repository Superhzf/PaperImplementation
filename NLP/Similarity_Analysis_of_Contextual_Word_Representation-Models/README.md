# Similarity Analysis of Contextual Word Representation Models
With the instructions and code in this repo, you should be able to reproduce the content of the paper [Similarity Analysis of Contextual Word Representation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01172.pdf). I will focus on how to implement the output of the paper instead of how the idea in the paper is developed.

#1 Data Preparation
## 1.1 Find the data-set
According to the authors, the data-set used in the paper is the development set of Penn Treebank data. You can obtain the raw data-set and preprocess using the `sanity_check.py` file.
